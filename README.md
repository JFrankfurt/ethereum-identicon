This react component shows a visual identifier for an ethereum address

This component is made to be identical to the visual identifiers present in the metamask project, in order to create visual continuity between a dApp and the metamask plugin which may be used to sign ethereum transactions.

This is also my first npm package, so please submit any improvements you see fit!

## Credit

Credit for this component is almost entirely due to Dan Finlay, who authored the jazzicon library this uses, and it's use in the metamask which this project seeks to emulate.  I wanted to package this, so that it could easily be included in my own projects, and by others.
